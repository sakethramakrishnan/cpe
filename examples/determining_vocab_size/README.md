# How does byte-pair encoding work?

The Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm is a compression technique commonly used in natural language processing to create subword tokenizers. The algorithm begins with an initialization of the vocabulary, where each unique symbol (character or byte) in the training corpus is considered a separate token. Through iterative merges of the most frequently occurring symbol pairs, the vocabulary is updated to create new, compound symbols. This process continues until a predefined vocabulary size is reached, enabling the capture of recurring subword patterns and improving the model's ability to represent complex linguistic structures in its tokenization.
